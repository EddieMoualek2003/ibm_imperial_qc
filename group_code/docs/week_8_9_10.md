# Week 8-10 Progress Report – 3D Printed Portable AI Quantum Machine

**Timeline:** 5 June – 23 June 2025  
**Prepared by:** Team 9

## Project Overview

The 3D Printed Portable AI Quantum Machine is a compact, Raspberry Pi–powered educational platform designed to make quantum computing approachable for all. By integrating IBM’s RasQberry framework, Qiskit-based games, and watsonx AI interfaces, it offers hands-on interaction with quantum concepts through visual, auditory, and natural-language interfaces.

The goal is to demystify quantum computing for broad audiences via immersive gameplay and intelligent voice-based guidance — all within a self-contained device.

## Progress Highlights

### 1. System Integration
- Integrated all developed quantum games and AI tools into a unified web interface.
- UI enhancements for RasQberry screen compatibility:
  - Dynamic font scaling
  - Unified color themes
  - Responsive controls for touch, keyboard, and GUI modes

### 2. Poster Design & Submission
- Poster completed and submitted for the University Open Day.
- Highlights:
  - Accessibility of quantum education
  - Interactive quantum gameplay
  - watsonx-powered AI integration
- Aimed at engaging and informing a non-technical audience.

### 3. Watson Speech-to-Text Integration
- Integrated IBM Watson STT with two key capabilities:
  - Ask Watson quantum-related questions via Granite-based LLM
  - Control selected games via voice commands
- Moves us closer to full AI-assisted voice navigation.

### 4. RasQberry Menu Integration
- Games added to the RasQberry menu system with tiered interface support:
  - All games support GUI
  - Some support Sense HAT / LED output
  - A few offer CLI-only interaction
- Goal: Universal interface compatibility for all games.

### 5. Model Design & 3D Enclosure
- System hardware upgrades (mic, speaker, screen, buttons) prompted redesign.
- New enclosure features:
  - Speaker and microphone mounts
  - Screen and button cut-outs
  - Ventilation slots
- UI scaling and resolution adapted using Pygame, thermal performance tested and debugged.

### 6. Documentation Development
Two branches of documentation in progress:

- University Submission
  - Architecture, code, specs, materials
  - Meeting records, design rationale

- Developer Reference (for Jan and future contributors)
  - Game structure and logic
  - Integration with IBM Cloud APIs
  - Setup and maintenance guides

### 7. Final Progress Video
- Delayed due to UI integration bugs (now resolved).
- Shows:
  - Demo UI – event-ready interface
  - Menu UI – core RasQberry OS layer for updates and launches

### 8. GitHub Integration
- Games hosted on individual GitHub repos
- RasQberry menu pulls directly from these sources
- Final pull request to Jan in progress (pending review and refinements)

### 9. Experimental Features
- Improved simulation quality via:
  - FakeManilaV2 noisy simulator
  - Cached quantum outputs (tested with Kevin and Luka)
- Deployment challenges:
  - Pickle platform issues (Windows vs WSL vs Linux)
- Heavy circuits still run on noiseless simulators due to Pi limitations

## Future Directions

Here are potential paths for advancing the platform post-demo:

- Universal Interface Support  
  Expand full GUI, CLI, and hardware output compatibility across all games.

- Online AI Deployment  
  Explore online models (e.g., TinyLLM) to reduce stress on the pi, and improve response times/quality.

- Enhanced Voice AI  
  Add wake-word detection, conversational memory, and multilingual support.

- Quantum Curriculum Expansion  
  Build a gamified learning progression with topic-based modules and achievements.

- Hardware and Thermal Optimization  
  Improve enclosure airflow and power management for extended usage.

- Plugin Hardware Modules  
  Introduce I/O extensions (sliders, sensors, rotary knobs) for more interactive play.

- Outreach and Education Kits  
  Package into deployable classroom/demo kits with setup scripts and guides.
