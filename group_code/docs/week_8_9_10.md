## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a 3D Printed Portable AI Quantum Machine — a Raspberry Pi-powered educational tool that combines IBM’s RasQberry framework, watsonx AI interfaces, and Qiskit-based quantum games. The objective is to demystify quantum computing for non-specialist audiences through interactive demonstrations and natural-language guidance.

## Key Progress Highlights

### 1. System Integration
- Successful integration of all developed quantum games and AI interaction tools into the main web interface.
- Graphical user interfaces updated to ensure visual coherence, and appropriate behaviour on the RasQberry screen, including:
  - Font scaling
  - Colour themes
  - Control responsiveness across different access methods, like touch, keyboard, GUI.
### 2. Poster Design and Submission
- The poster was completed and submitted, which will be used at the university open day to communicate the project's core idea to a wider audience.
- The poster outlines the motivation behind the work:
  - Make quantum computing education more accessible to everyone.
  - Update the platform with new and exciting interactive games that cover a variety of quantum topics
  - Power the AI assistant using IBM Watson AI Platform.
- The poster plays a very key role in making the project understandable and engaging for a non-technical audience.
### 3. Integration of Watson STT
- A major contribution to the platform is the integration of IBM Watson Speech-to-Text.
- Users can now use this to interact through the system in two key ways:
  - Ask Watson quantum questions, and receive a response, through the Granite-based LLM.
  - Navigate through the games using voice commands (for selected games, with intent to bring to all)
  - This brings the project very close to completing the "stretch goal" of full AI-assisted navigation 
### 4. Final RasQberry Integration
- Games are being modified and added to the RasQberry menu system, allowing for seamless launching from the Raspberry Pi. There are differing levels of interface support; GUI, external hardware, like sensehat, sensehat EMU and LED array, and command line interface (CLI). Games are in one of the three stages:
  - Each game currently supports full GUI mode.
  - Some games support external hardware interfaces.
  - Few games support CLI.
- The aim is to have all games supporting all interfaces, however, this will take some time.
### 5. Final Model Design and Assembly
- Due to the modifications made to the system, including adding speaker and microphone interfaces, a screen for GUI-based games and buttons for AI triggering, design changes had to be made to the 3D enclosure.
- Key changes include:
  - Speaker mounts.
  - Microphone and button cut-outs.
  - Cut-outs for ventilation.
  - Screen mounts.
- Refinements to the early prototypes based on model evaluation and performance analysis (e.g., how hot the Pi ran in the enclosure) were carried out, turning a prototype into a polished, portable demo device.
- The screen has been embedded into the front face, and the system has been tested extensively to adjust resolution, debug errors, and dynamically resize the UI using Pygame.

### 6. Documentation Preparation
- Documentation for the project is two fold, and below is the indicative content for each
  - Requirements for the University
    - System Architecture
    - Relevant Code
    - Specifications
    - Materials Sourced and Used
    - Record of Meetings had
    - Decisions taken with rationale
  - Maintenance documentation for Jan and future system developers
    - Function of the games
    - Full documentation on how the games function
    - Integration and detailed architecture description of interaction with IBM's cloud service.
- The aim is to make it easy for future developers, students, or IBM staff to expand upon our work — whether that means adding new games, updating AI models, or deploying to new hardware.
### 7. Final Progress Update Video
- The final video has taken longer to produce than expected.
- The plan was for it to show a fully working system from two sides:
  - The `demo` UI, that would be shown at events to showcase the platform.
  - The `menu` UI, which is the core of the RasQberry OS, and how most people would interface with the OS, as it is responsible for ensuring all games are up-to-date and is a sure way to run all the games.
- Both the `demo` and `menu` UIs had several integration bugs, which had to be fixed before the video could be made.
- These have been fixed and the video has been produced.

### 8. Final Pull Requests
- The group will be hosting the games they developed on their own GitHub repositories.
- The RasQberry menu system then queries and pulls these from there.
- Once all GitHubs have been set up, a final pull request will be made to Jan, for official integration into the latest RasQberry release (after several revisions and fixes of errors, surely!).
### 9. Experimental Features
- It was previously noted that the local simulator does not perform very well compared with the quantum computer.
- For some time, a local noisy simulator based on `FakeManillaV2` served as the solution to this.
- In a discussion with Kevin (Author of `Quantum_Raspberry_Tie`) and Luka (Author of `Light_Out`), the idea of using a cached model of the quantum computer was suggested.
- This was tested, and while the results were significantly better, there were deployment issues on the Pi, likely due to how `Pickle` works between different platforms, like Windows, WSL and full Linux
- More complex circuits are still based on the noise-less simulator due to stress on the Pi.
